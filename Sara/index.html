						Adrienne Rich was a poet and essayist who had many well-known publications over her decades long career some include Diving into the Wreck: Poems 1971-1972 (1973)  and Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Institution and Experience (1976). Her work was famously radical as it examines the topics of feminism, politics, racism, and identity in a post-World War II America. She was awarded many honors such as the MacArthur “Genius” Award, the National Book Award, and was offered the National Medal for Arts but refused it.

					<p id="text">
						Throughout the 1970s and 1980s her works were primary readings during the second wave of the Women’s Liberation Movement. They often challenged the relative role of women in society and in the home and discussed the affliction of traditional gender roles which eventually led to her separation from her husband in 1970. Rich moved to California in the 1980s with her partner Michelle Cliff. She wrote an essay titled “Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence” (1980) that declared heterosexuality a patriarchal construct that only straight men benefited from. Her work was often criticized for being angry and dark, but that is what others found inspiring.
					</p>
					<p id="text">
						She was a powerful and motivating voice of her time. Her career documented a metamorphosis of a compliant wife and daughter to an unequivocal social activist. Her poems left a legacy of gender equality and queer empowerment in California and across the nation. They inspired future generations to be conscious of the world they are living in and abandon the traditions that hold them back. They shined a light on those who are often overlooked and showed off their value.

				<h2>Planetarium</h2>
				<p>“Thinking of Caroline Herschel (1750–1848)
				astronomer, sister of William; and others.<br></br><br></br>

				A woman in the shape of a monster
				a monster in the shape of a woman
				the skies are full of them<br></br><br></br>

				a woman    ‘in the snow
				among the Clocks and instruments
				or measuring the ground with poles’
				in her 98 years to discover
				8 comets<br></br><br></br>

				she whom the moon ruled
				like us
				levitating into the night sky
				riding the polished lenses<br></br<br></br>

				Galaxies of women, there
				doing penance for impetuousness
				ribs chilled
				in those spaces    of the mind<br></br><br></br>

				An eye,<br></br><br></br>

				‘virile, precise and absolutely certain’
				from the mad webs of Uranusborg<br></br><br></br>

				encountering the NOVA<br></br><br></br>

				every impulse of light exploding<br></br><br></br>

				from the core
				as life flies out of us<br></br><br></br>

				Tycho whispering at last
				‘Let me not seem to have lived in vain’<br></br><br></br>

				What we see, we see
				and seeing is changing<br></br><br></br>

				the light that shrivels a mountain
				and leaves a man alive<br></br><br></br>

				Heartbeat of the pulsar
				heart sweating through my body<br></br><br></br>

				The radio impulse
				pouring in from Taurus<br></br>

				I am bombarded yet    I stand<br></br><br></br>

				I have been standing all my life in the
				direct path of a battery of signals
				the most accurately transmitted most
				untranslatable language in the universe
				I am a galactic cloud so deep    so invo-
				luted that a light wave could take 15
				years to travel through me    And has
				taken    I am an instrument in the shape
				of a woman trying to translate pulsations
				into images    for the relief of the body
				and the reconstruction of the mind.”<br></br>

					<p>In this poem, Rich criticizes and comments on the expectations that society places on women. She does what is surprising when she honors women’s discoveries in astronomy and science and when referring to women in an indelicate and sordid manner. She highlights achievements that fall beyond what was anticipated from women. The last section of the poem explains the discomfort Rich experienced being a woman and then alludes to disembodiment and being unattached from womanhood.
The format of the poem is a vessel that also holds meaning. It begins somewhat unorganized and surprising. It does not follow any usual layout. Then it conforms to the standard couplets and then reverts back to rejecting common format by finishing the poem in a large block of text. The poem itself is a metaphor for the experience of a woman. 	</p>
