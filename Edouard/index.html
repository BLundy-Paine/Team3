					Poet, novelist, and professor Al Young was born in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. He attended the University of Michigan before moving to the San Francisco Bay area, where he earned a BA in Spanish from the University of California-Berkeley. Young often read to musical accompaniment, and his poetry reflected his interest in music, specifically jazz and blues, as well as his life in California.
					</p>
					<p id="text">
					Mr. Young, who published his first volume of poetry, “Dancing,” in 1969, was California’s poet laureate from 2005 to 2008, years he spent advocating for poetry and bringing it to audiences of all sorts. He thought poetry and music were close cousins, though he viewed the relationship differently than some earlier poets had. Moreover, he twice received the American Book Award, for Bodies and Soul: Musical Memoirs (1982) and The Sound of Dreams Remembered: Poems 1990-2000 (2002).
					</p>
					<p id="text">
					On 2018, he released a CD, "Something about the blues" which is a collection of poems wrote. "Something About the Blues" includes an audio CD with Al Young's dynamic, soulful readings of more than 20 of the poems from the book, plus Langston Hughes' reading of his classic "The Weary Blues." Many of Young's performances feature a live blues band.

					One West Coast</div>
				<p>Green is the color of everything<br>
					that isn't brown, the tones ranging<br>
					like mountains, the colors changing.<br>

You look up toward the hills & fog—<br>
the familiarity of it after so many years<br>
a resident tourist.<br>
A young man walks<br>
toward you in vague streetcrossing denims<br>
& pronounced boots. From the pallor of<br>
his gait, the orange splotch twin gobs of sunset<br>
in his shades, from the way he vibrates<br>
his surrounding air, you can tell, you can tell<br>
he's friendly, circulating,<br>

he's a Californian: comes to visit,<br>
stays for years, marries, moves a wife in,<br>
kids, wears out TV sets, get stranded on<br>
loneliness,<br>
afternoon pharmaceutica,<br>
so that the sky's got moon in it by<br>
3 o'clock, is blooo, is blown—<br>

The girls: theyre all<br>
winners reared by grandmothers & CBS.<br>
Luckier ones get in a few dances with<br>
mom, a few hours, before dad goes back<br>
in the slam, before "G'bye I'm off<br>
to be a singer!" & another runaway<br>
Miss American future drifts<br>
over the mountain &<br>
into the clouds.<br>
Still<br>
there's a beautifulness about California.<br>
It's based on the way each eyeblink toward<br>
the palms & into the orange grove leads backstage<br>
into the onionfields.<br>
Unreachable, winter happens inside you.<br>
Your unshaded eyes dilate at the spectacle.<br>
You take trips to contain the mystery<br>
