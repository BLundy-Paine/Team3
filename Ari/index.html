						"My name is Vincent Randazzo. I’ve written and performed music with a number of different projects for the last 10 years. With multiple west coast and national tours under my belt the road has become a second home. In 2018 I left on an aimless, indefinite jaunt across the country. My journal entries at the time took the form of poems and three months later returning home I realized the poems could take the form of a book. In 2021 I discovered that I have a cognitive variation called Aphantasia. In a nutshell, this means I have no visual thought processes. In fact, my mind’s landscape is entirely dark and mute. I can hear no monologue in my head. Not my voice. No music. I can’t visualize the faces of my family or friends. I can’t picture things even as primaries as a circle or square. All of my memories are intellectually based; devoid of episodic recall. I remember my life like one might remember the plot points of a book they read earlier in the year. Discovering this truth was a huge moment of self discovery and my artist process was one of the first things I found myself brought into question. How does Aphantasia, a phenomenon estimated to occur in 2-3% of the population, affect how people are creative? I realized quickly that my book of poems was a personal utility first, an external hard drive of sorts to outsource my memory to, and a piece of artwork second. Aphantasia and the artistic process is now one of my favorite things to ponder."

						Throughout the 1970s and 1980s her works were primary readings during the second wave of the Women’s Liberation Movement. They often challenged the relative role of women in society and in the home and discussed the affliction of traditional gender roles which eventually led to her separation from her husband in 1970. Rich moved to California in the 1980s with her partner Michelle Cliff. She wrote an essay titled “Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence” (1980) that declared heterosexuality a patriarchal construct that only straight men benefited from. Her work was often criticized for being angry and dark, but that is what others found inspiring.

						She was a powerful and motivating voice of her time. Her career documented a metamorphosis of a compliant wife and daughter to an unequivocal social activist. Her poems left a legacy of revolution against oppressive institutions. They inspired future generations to be conscious of the world they are living in and abandon the traditions that hold them back. They shined a light on those who are often overlooked and showed off their value.

				<p>“Thinking of Caroline Herschel (1750–1848)
				astronomer, sister of William; and others.

				A woman in the shape of a monster
				a monster in the shape of a woman
				the skies are full of them

				a woman    ‘in the snow
				among the Clocks and instruments
				or measuring the ground with poles’

				in her 98 years to discover
				8 comets

				she whom the moon ruled
				like us
				levitating into the night sky
				riding the polished lenses

				Galaxies of women, there
				doing penance for impetuousness
				ribs chilled
				in those spaces    of the mind

				An eye,

				‘virile, precise and absolutely certain’
				from the mad webs of Uranusborg

				encountering the NOVA

				every impulse of light exploding

				from the core
				as life flies out of us

				Tycho whispering at last
				‘Let me not seem to have lived in vain’

				What we see, we see
				and seeing is changing

				the light that shrivels a mountain
				and leaves a man alive

				Heartbeat of the pulsar
				heart sweating through my body

				The radio impulse
				pouring in from Taurus

				I am bombarded yet    I stand

				I have been standing all my life in the
				direct path of a battery of signals
				the most accurately transmitted most
				untranslatable language in the universe
				I am a galactic cloud so deep    so invo-
				luted that a light wave could take 15
				years to travel through me    And has
				taken    I am an instrument in the shape
				of a woman trying to translate pulsations
				into images    for the relief of the body
				and the reconstruction of the mind.”
