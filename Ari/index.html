					"During late summer of 2019, I found myself on a binge for new artists. I spent a lot of time searching the area for musicians and artists to fill my need for art. Discovering Vincent Randazzo midway through this expedition was the highlight of this period. His art and music resonated so deeply with me, and his kind nature and charisma made him The Gem of Monterey Bay. I spent a couple months getting to know him and disecting his music and writing style. During this time, he taught be much about himself and his process. Over the past five years of his career Randazzo had released six albums and toured the US regionally seven times. Seemingly on an expidition to nowhere, with dream and aspirations in mind that he no longer cares for. His style reflects that of 'freak-folk' and his music relates accordingly. Randazzo gives those he meets a peice of himself unselfishly, allowing you to feel things on his level, and changing your persepective on what the mind is really capable of. "

					ARTIST BACKGROUND
					"My name is Vincent Randazzo. I’ve written and performed music with a number of different projects for the last 10 years. With multiple west coast and national tours under my belt the road has become a second home. In 2018 I left on an aimless, indefinite jaunt across the country. My journal entries at the time took the form of poems and three months later returning home I realized the poems could take the form of a book. In 2021 I discovered that I have a cognitive variation called Aphantasia. In a nutshell, this means I have no visual thought processes. In fact, my mind’s landscape is entirely dark and mute. I can hear no monologue in my head. Not my voice. No music. I can’t visualize the faces of my family or friends. I can’t picture things even as primaries as a circle or square. All of my memories are intellectually based; devoid of episodic recall. I remember my life like one might remember the plot points of a book they read earlier in the year. Discovering this truth was a huge moment of self discovery and my artist process was one of the first things I found myself brought into question. How does Aphantasia, a phenomenon estimated to occur in 2-3% of the population, affect how people are creative? I realized quickly that my book of poems was a personal utility first, an external hard drive of sorts to outsource my memory to, and a piece of artwork second. Aphantasia and the artistic process is now one of my favorite things to ponder."

					Q:“As an artist with aphantasia, your artistic process is unique from most other artists. What is the most difficult part of your process?”
					Mr. Randazzo: "Having aphantasia, the most difficult part of my artistic process is probably the immediacy of it all. Due to the lack of an episodic memory, it’s very difficult for me to revisit events on an emotional level. Emotional recall is something I’ve heard many aphants grapple with. That being said, when inspiration strikes I often feel the need to drop everything I’m doing and follow the it or else lose the throughline of the piece. Most of my poems and songs are written in one sitting and once that moment has passed the work usually moves from a very visceral space to an incredibly intellectual one."

					Q:"“If you could speak to someone who may be where you were before you started your artistic journey, what advice would you offer them?”
					Mr. Randazzo: "I would recommend to anyone starting their artistic journey to really be thoughtful with their motives and foundation. If your work is primarily for others there is a huge potential for burnout. If you can frame your work as being for you but with the added bonus of being for others it can be far more sustainable; your artistic journey begins to feed itself.
					In this same way, finding your voice is far more important than pushing your voice into the realm of other successful artists. Some of my favorite artists tried copying their heroes only to fall short and land in themselves. You are ready to make art from any moment- don’t wait until you are at the same tier as your inspirations of you may be waiting forever. This journey will be the journey of you accepting yourself and finding the truth in every stage of life."

			<h4>Limbo
			[10/13/18]</h4>
	Today was limbo<br>
	Orange autumn leaves<br>
	Not yet fallen<br>
	The first cold breath of winter<br>
	We drove from Brooklyn<br>
	To Baltimore<br>
	It’s amazing you’re real<br>
	More amazing you’re alive<br>
	Months of phone calls<br>
	Instagram stories<br>
	But you are so much more<br>
	Than a voice<br>
	Face!<br>
	Wit!<br>
	I remember<br>
	I’d forgotten how you breathe<br>
<br>
	Today Was<br>
	limbo<br>
	Starting conversations<br>
	And letting the radio finish<br>
	Questions with no answers<br>
	Leaving us in tears<br>
	Crying how everything<br>
	Feels nothing<br>
	Stopping for coffee<br>
	To pee<br>
	To walk the railroad tracks<br>
	Summit an abandoned flat car<br>
	And nearly kiss<br>
	Forced to find satisfaction<br>
	In watching your hair dance<br>
	At the edge of the steel<br>
	Like you might jump<br>
	Seeing you look back to me<br>
	But further back<br>
	Are you waiting for me to embrace you<br>
	Or into the distance<br>
	So you can pick vines and ferns<br>
	Because there aren’t any flowers?</p>
